# Django Test

## What is this?

A django-rest-framework basic CRUD test using psql.

Hosted on [Demo](https://cho-django-test.herokuapp.com/) using Heroku.

There are two main end points
- students/
- schools/

and one nested end point
- schools/{id}/students

[PUT, POST, GET, DELETE] methods are avialable for all endpoints.
For example
- GET students/ will return all students
- GET students/{id} will return a student
- POST students/ will create new students
- PUT students/{id} will update a student
- DELETE students/{id} will delete a student

Order, Filter and Pagination are also available.
For example
- GET students/?gpa=3&school=2 will return only students who has gpa 3 and register under school 2
- GET students/?ordering=gpa will return the result sorted by gpa
- GET students?/page=2 will return 2nd page paginated by 25 sizes

Bad request are handled in such manners
- Business logic are validated in serializers, e.g. gpa must be between 0 and 4, the school can't accept students more than max limit
- General validations are handled in model itsef, e.g. school name can't be null and can't accept more than 20 characters

They all will return BadRequest HTTP Response with proper message

Test cases for all APIs are added in /tests

Populate fake data, for testing purpose

$ make populate

finally run it :D

$ make run

run tests

$ make test

[Optional] check url list

$ make show_urls
